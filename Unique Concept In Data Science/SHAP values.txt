🔍 SHAP Values (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

What it is:
SHAP is a game-theory-based method used to explain the output of any machine learning model. 
It tells you how much each feature contributed to a particular prediction.

////💡 What is SHAP?

SHAP helps us understand why a machine learning model made a specific prediction.

Imagine you’re predicting whether a person will survive the Titanic based on their data (like age, gender, ticket class, etc.). Your model gives a prediction like:

    ❗ "This person will not survive."

But... why did the model say that? 🤔

That’s where SHAP comes in.

🔍 SHAP Tells You:

    "This person didn’t survive mainly because:

        👤 Gender = male (bad for survival in Titanic)

        🎫 Ticket class = 3rd (poorer class, less chance)

        💰 Fare = low

        🧓 Age = young (small positive effect)
        "

It tells you which features helped and which features hurt the prediction.
📊 Two Types of Plots:

    Force Plot (Single Person):

        Explains one prediction.

        Shows how each feature pushed the prediction toward survive or not.

    Summary Plot (All People):

        Explains which features matter the most overall.

        E.g., "Gender" might be the most important feature.

🔁 Example in Real Life:

Like a teacher saying:

    "Swagat got 70 marks. Here's why:

        He studied well for English.

        But didn’t prepare much for Math.

        And missed one assignment."

That’s what SHAP does — it justifies the model’s result like a teacher justifies a grade.

ðŸŽ¯ Concept: Dimensionality Reduction with t-SNE

(Visualizing high-dimensional data in a way our brain understands)
ðŸ§  What is it?

Imagine you have a dataset with hundreds of features (e.g., pixels in an image, sensors in IoT, words in a sentence). Itâ€™s hard to visualize or understand this data directly.

Thatâ€™s where t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) comes in.

It reduces high-dimensional data to 2D or 3D so you can visualize it â€” while keeping the structure and relationships between points!
